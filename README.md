# Automation Scripts in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains two automation scripts written in Python: one to resize images and the other to organize files. These scripts are designed to make tasks that would otherwise take a lot of time much more efficient.

## Requirements
The following packages are required for these scripts:
- `Pillow` (for image resizing)
- `os` (for file organization)

## Usage
Each script can be executed using a Python environment with the required packages installed. Simply run the script and the relevant actions will be performed.

## Image Resizing Script
This script resizes all images in a designated directory to a specified size. It can be used to quickly resize a large number of images for a specific purpose (e.g. reducing file size for faster uploading).

## File Organization Script
This script organizes all files in a designated directory into subdirectories based on their file type (e.g. all `.jpg` files will be placed in a `jpg` directory). This can be useful for keeping a cluttered directory organized and easier to navigate.

## Conclusion
These automation scripts demonstrate the power of Python in automating repetitive tasks. By using these scripts, time can be saved and manual errors can be reduced. These concepts can be expanded upon and applied to other tasks for even greater efficiency.
